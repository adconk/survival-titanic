title: "AWS Lambda: API Deployment"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 


```{r}
library(reticulate)
use_python("/usr/bin/python3", required = TRUE)
awsrpy <- import("serveRless")
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3', prompt = TRUE}

import serveRless
builder_instance = serveRless.serveRless()
#builder_instance.create("adc_test")
builder_instance.terminate()

```
